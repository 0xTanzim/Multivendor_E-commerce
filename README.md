# Multi Vendor E-commerce Platform

This is a **multi-vendor e-commerce platform** built with **Next.js, Prisma, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS**. The project is structured as a **monorepo** using **TurboRepo** and **pnpm-workspaces** to manage multiple applications efficiently.

The backend follows **OOP principles**, reducing code duplication with a **BaseRepository** and **BaseService** pattern. Dependency injection is managed using **Tsyringe**, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

A custom Error Library is implemented to handle errors effectively, and an **Error Handler** is used to catch unhandled exceptions.
